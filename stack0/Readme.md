## Stack 0

So for this stage we're given the following code:

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);

  if(modified != 0) {
      printf("you have changed the 'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
```
and if it's not obvious by the name, we're trying to exploit a buffer overflow on the stack in this program. Looking over the code we notice a couple of things

1. The if statement at the bottom checks the modified variable, and if it doesn't equal 0 then we get "you have changed the 'modified' variable". If modified, is 0 we get "Try Again"
2. Our input is going to be stored in the variable buffer, which is a 64 byte sized character array, and we're using the gets function to grab the user input

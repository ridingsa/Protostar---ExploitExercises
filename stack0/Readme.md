## Stack 0

So for this stage we're given the following code:

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);

  if(modified != 0) {
      printf("you have changed the 'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
```
and if it's not obvious by the name, we're trying to exploit a buffer overflow on the stack in this program. Looking over the code we notice a couple of things

1. The if statement at the bottom checks the modified variable, and if it doesn't equal 0 then we get "you have changed the 'modified' variable". If modified, is 0 we get "Try Again"
2. Our input is going to be stored in the variable buffer, which is a 64 byte sized character array, and we're using the gets function to grab the user input

Putting two and two together we have to overwrite the modified variable to not equal zero. Lets start this up in GDB and look at it from another point of view:

```assembly
(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:

End of assembler dump.
```
We can see above that at ```<main+9> movl $0x0,0x5c(%esp)``` we're pushing a 0 onto the stack. This is most likely our modified variable. We can check by placing a breakpoint at that instruction and looking at the stack before and after

## Stack 3

So for this stage we're given the following code:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win()
{
  printf("code flow successfully changed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int (*fp)();
  char buffer[64];

  fp = 0;

  gets(buffer);

  if(fp) {
      printf("calling function pointer, jumping to 0x%08x\n", fp);
      fp();
  }
}

```
The object of this challenge is to get control of EIP and then call the "win" function. While this seems kind of trivial, it's probably to get students comfortable with jumping to fuctions so they can use ret2libc style techinques and ROP.
